This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(DESeq2)

set.seed(584)

# 5 by 10 matrix of random integers between 100 and 10000 simulating gene expression counts
n_genes = 5
n_samples = 10
x_matrix <- matrix(
  sample(100:10000, n_genes * n_samples, replace = TRUE),
  nrow = n_genes,
  ncol = n_samples
)

#defining row and column names
rownames(x = x_matrix) <- c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3", "gene4", "gene5")
colnames(x_matrix) <- c(paste0("cond", 1:5), paste0("ctrl", 1:5))

#separate condition and control columns
coldata <- data.frame(
  condition = factor(rep(c("cond", "ctrl"), each = 5)),
  row.names = colnames(x_matrix)
)

# create a DEseq data set
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(
  countData =x_matrix,
  colData = coldata,
  design = ~ condition
)

dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
norm_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

#calculate fold changes using gene means of deseq normalized expression data under condition and control
condition_mean <- rowMeans(norm_counts[, 1:5])
control_mean <- rowMeans(norm_counts[, 6:10])
fold_change <- condition_mean / control_mean

data.frame(gene = rownames(x_matrix),
           fc = fold_change)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
